## 0.9.4
* bug fixes around default value handling
* **BREAKING CHANGE**: DRAFT transformation revisions with a released timestamp will no longer be accepted but cause a ValueError. A database migration fixing affected components and workflows is added. However if you export(ed) transformations with an earlier version than 0.9 and afterwards import them into a version >=0.9.4 the transformations may again include the bug. We therefore strongly recommend that you **make a backup and/or export both before and after upgrading**.

## 0.9.3
* improve dashboarding token refresh
* minor fixes and documentation improvements

## 0.9.2
* **BREAKING CHANGE**: Fixed environment variable name `HETIDA_DESIGNER_RUNTIME_ENGINE_URL` (from mispelled `HETIDA_DESIGNER_RUNTIME_EGINE_URL`)
* Add experimental [dashboarding](./docs/dashboarding.md) feature

## 0.9.1
* add [restricted-to-execution-of-preselected trafos webservice mode](./docs/execution/restricted_webservice.md)

## 0.9.0
* add [optional inputs with default parameters](./docs/default_values.md)
* add [structured exception handling](./docs/structuring_exceptions.md)
  :warning: **BREAKING CHANGE**: The attribute `error` in the response JSON of the execute endpoint is no longer a string but a mapping/dictionary 
* add [free text filters for outputs (adapter system)](./docs/adapter_system/)
* add blob storage adapter config options
* add general [sql adapter](./docs/adapter_system/sql_adapter.md) with timeseries table support
* add [improved metadata attrs handling](./docs/metadata_attrs.md) - in particular a manual input method
  * **BREAKING CHANGE**: Consequently the output json format for direct provisioning has changed to include metadata for dataframes, multitsframes and (time)series objects.
* add python demo adapter sources and output free text filters
* add additional validations
* fix workflow validation issues via db migration
* fix filter for categories in export
* upgrade to python 3.11
* upgrade dependencies
* **WARNING/BREAKING CHANGE**: One of the introduced bugfixes includes a database migration fixing affected workflows. However if you export(ed) transformations with an earlier version than 0.9 and afterwards import them into a version >=0.9 the transformations may again include the bug. We therefore strongly recommend that you **make a backup and/or export both before and after upgrading**.

See the changed default docker-compose setup!** 
* automatic deployment of base components. Documented [here](https://github.com/hetida/hetida-designer/blob/develop/docs/base_component_deployment.md).
* usability improvements wiring / selection dialog
* adapter system: directly attach any metadata as attributes to dataframes / series. See for example [here](https://github.com/hetida/hetida-designer/blob/develop/docs/adapter_system/generic_rest_adapters/web_service_interface.md#dataframe-get)
