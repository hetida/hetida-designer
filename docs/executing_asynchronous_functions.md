# Executing asynchronous functions in Hetida Designer

The Hetida Designer allows the execution of *asynchronous* functions also. To this end, add `async` in front of the definition of the main function in the component code.  

> :warning: Except for adding `async`, changes in the lines between `# ***** DO NOT EDIT LINES BELOW *****` and `# ***** DO NOT EDIT LINES ABOVE *****` in the component code will be reversed within the next automatic buffering, which takes place every few seconds.
