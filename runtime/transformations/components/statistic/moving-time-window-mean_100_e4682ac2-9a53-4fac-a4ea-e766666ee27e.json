Can be either a Pandas frequency string based on [date offset aliases](https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/user_guide/timeseries.html#timeseries-offset-aliases) or a timedelta string.\n* **window_frequency** (String): Time span between window starts. Can be either a Pandas frequency string based on [date offset aliases](https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/user_guide/timeseries.html#timeseries-offset-aliases) or a timedelta string. For directly consecutive, non-overlapping windows set **window_frequency** to the same value as **window_size**.\n* **frequency_offset** (String): Offset of the window starts compared to 1970-01-01 00:00:00. Can be either a Pandas frequency string based on [date offset aliases](https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/user_guide/timeseries.html#timeseries-offset-aliases) or a timedelta string. In most cases no offset is necessary, so this can be set to zero, i.e. \"0\".\n* **interval_type** (String): The string must be one of \"left_closed\", \"right_open\", \"right_closed\", \"left_closed\" \"closed\", or \"open\". In case a datapoint is on the left or right edge of a window this option determines if it belongs to that window or not, but potentially a neighbouring window.\n* **label_position** (String): The string must be either \"left\", \"center\", or \"right\". This option determines which timestamp is provided to represent the window for the corresponding mean in the output time series. \n\n## Outputs\n* **window_means** (Pandas Series): Series with the calculated means of each window.\n\n## Details\nThe datapoints of the **timeseries** are associated with time windows whose lengths are specified by **window_size**, and which are repeated with the frequency specified by **window_frequency** and the offset specified by **frequency_offset**.\nTo obtain for example windows with a **window_frequency** of \"5min\" that do not start at :00, :05, :10, :15 and so on, but instead at :04, :09, :14, :19 and so on, just set the **frequency_offset** to \"4min\" as in the example below.\n\nThe parameter **interval_type** is used to determine if a datapoint just on the edge of a window belongs to that window. The values \"left_closed\" and \"right_open\" mean that a point on the left edge of a window belongs to this window, whereas a point on its right edge does not belong to it. The values \"right_closed\" and \"left_open\" mean the same but vice versa, wheras \"closed\" means that both belong to the window, and \"open\" means that none of these points belong to the window.\n\nThe mean of all datapoints associated to the same time period is calculated. The value of **label_position** determines at which position of the window the label for the mean value of the window should be placed.\n\nThe time series does not need to have a regular frequency, and the window size can even be smaller than the smallest distance between successive observations, which then results in empty windows. For empty windows, the result value is NaN.\nIf NaN values are present in the original time series, they are eliminated before calculating the mean.\n\nTo reduce the execution time, if possible (**window_frequency** and **window_size** are identical, the **label_position** is \"left\" or \"right\") the Pandas function resample is used instead of the Pandas function rolling.\n\n##

  "documentation": "# Moving Time Window Mean\n\n## Description\nThis component calculates the mean of observations in time windows of fixed size moving over the data with a fixed frequency.\n\n## Inputs\n* **timeseries** (Pandas Series): Series to perform the moving mean calculation on.\n* **window_size** (String): Time span of each window. Can be either a Pandas frequency string based on [date offset aliases](https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/user_guide/timeseries.html#timeseries-offset-aliases) or a timedelta string.\n* **window_frequency** (String): Time span between window starts. Can be either a Pandas frequency string based on [date offset aliases](https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/user_guide/timeseries.html#timeseries-offset-aliases) or a timedelta string. For directly consecutive, non-overlapping windows set **window_frequency** to the same value as **window_size**.\n* **frequency_offset** (String): Offset of the window starts compared to 1970-01-01 00:00:00. Can be either a Pandas frequency string based on [date offset aliases](https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/user_guide/timeseries.html#timeseries-offset-aliases) or a timedelta string. In most cases no offset is necessary, so this can be set to zero, i.e. \"0\".\n* **interval_type** (String): The string must be one of \"left_closed\", \"right_open\", \"right_closed\", \"left_closed\" \"closed\", or \"open\". In case a datapoint is on the left or right edge of a window this option determines if it belongs to that window or not, but potentially a neighbouring window.\n* **label_position** (String): The string must be either \"left\", \"center\", or \"right\". This option determines which timestamp is provided to represent the window for the corresponding mean in the output time series. \n\n## Outputs\n* **window_means** (Pandas Series): Series with the calculated means of each window.\n\n## Details\nThe datapoints of the **timeseries** are associated with time windows whose lengths are specified by **window_size**, and which are repeated with the frequency specified by **window_frequency** and the offset specified by **frequency_offset**.\nTo obtain for example windows with a **window_frequency** of \"5min\" that do not start at :00, :05, :10, :15 and so on, but instead at :04, :09, :14, :19 and so on, just set the **frequency_offset** to \"4min\" as in the example below.\n\nThe parameter **interval_type** is used to determine if a datapoint just on the edge of a window belongs to that window. The values \"left_closed\" and \"right_open\" mean that a point on the left edge of a window belongs to this window, whereas a point on its right edge does not belong to it. The values \"right_closed\" and \"left_open\" mean the same but vice versa, wheras \"closed\" means that both belong to the window, and \"open\" means that none of these points belong to the window.\n\nThe mean of all datapoints associated to the same time period is calculated. The value of **label_position** determines at which position of the window the label for the mean value of the window should be placed.\n\nThe time series does not need to have a regular frequency, and the window size can even be smaller than the smallest distance between successive observations, which then results in empty windows. For empty windows, the result value is NaN.\nIf NaN values are present in the original time series, they are eliminated before calculating the mean.\n\nTo reduce the execution time, if possible (**window_frequency** and **window_size** are identical, the **label_position** is \"left\" or \"right\") the Pandas function resample is used instead of the Pandas function rolling.\n\n## Examples\nThe json input of a typical call of this component is\n```\n{\n    \"timeseries\": {\n        \"2022-12-06 23:17:14+00:00\": 14.360453,\n        \"2022-12-06 23:18:14+00:00\": 14.872439,\n        \"2022-12-06 23:19:14+00:00\": 15.803046,\n        \"2022-12-06 23:20:14+00:00\": 13.661063,\n        \"2022-12-06 23:21:14+00:00\": 14.969653,\n        \"2022-12-06 23:22:14+00:00\": 13.530460,\n        \"2022-12-06 23:23:14+00:00\": 14.009814,\n        \"2022-12-06 23:24:14+00:00\": 13.708907,\n        \"2022-12-06 23:25:14+00:00\": 15.119281,\n        \"2022-12-06 23:26:14+00:00\": 15.666053,\n        \"2022-12-06 23:27:14+00:00\": 15.488811,\n        \"2022-12-06 23:28:14+00:00\": 15.515572,\n        \"2022-12-06 23:29:14+00:00\": 14.767891,\n        \"2022-12-06 23:30:14+00:00\": 13.726783,\n        \"2022-12-06 23:31:14+00:00\": 14.997352,\n        \"2022-12-06 23:32:14+00:00\": 13.015161,\n        \"2022-12-06 23:33:14+00:00\": 15.079884,\n        \"2022-12-06 23:34:14+00:00\": 15.001638,\n        \"2022-12-06 23:35:14+00:00\": 16.035476,\n        \"2022-12-06 23:36:14+00:00\": 14.545874,\n        \"2022-12-06 23:37:14+00:00\": 13.970260,\n        \"2022-12-06 23:38:14+00:00\": 15.045999,\n        \"2022-12-06 23:39:14+00:00\": 13.824304,\n        \"2022-12-06 23:40:14+00:00\": 13.620449,\n        \"2022-12-06 23:41:14+00:00\": 15.146005,\n        \"2022-12-06 23:42:14+00:00\": 14.796941,\n        \"2022-12-06 23:43:14+00:00\": 17.036046,\n        \"2022-12-06 23:44:14+00:00\": 14.976151,\n        \"2022-12-06 23:45:14+00:00\": 14.637615,\n        \"2022-12-06 23:46:14+00:00\": 15.195011,\n        \"2022-12-06 23:47:14+00:00\": 14.082022,\n        \"2022-12-06 23:48:14+00:00\": 15.311653,\n        \"2022-12-06 23:49:14+00:00\": 15.534084,\n        \"2022-12-06 23:50:14+00:00\": 15.020099,\n        \"2022-12-06 23:51:14+00:00\": 14.020416,\n        \"2022-12-06 23:52:14+00:00\": 13.779699,\n        \"2022-12-06 23:53:14+00:00\": 14.407253,\n        \"2022-12-06 23:54:14+00:00\": 15.180839,\n        \"2022-12-06 23:55:14+00:00\": 14.618573,\n        \"2022-12-06 23:56:14+00:00\": 14.194774,\n        \"2022-12-06 23:57:14+00:00\": 14.653221,\n        \"2022-12-06 23:58:14+00:00\": 14.911146,\n        \"2022-12-06 23:59:14+00:00\": 14.951289,\n        \"2022-12-07 00:00:14+00:00\": 15.005731,\n        \"2022-12-07 00:01:14+00:00\": 15.708401,\n        \"2022-12-07 00:02:14+00:00\": 13.605439,\n        \"2022-12-07 00:03:14+00:00\": 14.620927,\n        \"2022-12-07 00:04:14+00:00\": 15.181250,\n        \"2022-12-07 00:05:14+00:00\": 13.912724,\n        \"2022-12-07 00:06:14+00:00\": 14.060204\n    },\n    \"window_size\": \"15min\",\n    \"window_frequency\": \"5min\",\n    \"frequency_offset\": \"4min\",\n    \"interval_type\": \"left_closed\",\n    \"label_positions\": \"left\"\n}\n```\nThe expected output is\n```\n\"mean_windows\": {\n    \"2022-12-06T23:14:00.000Z\": 14.616446,\n    \"2022-12-06T23:19:00.000Z\": 14.3948072,\n    \"2022-12-06T23:24:00.000Z\": 15.0997248,\n    \"2022-12-06T23:29:00.000Z\": 14.3174142,\n    \"2022-12-06T23:34:00.000Z\": 14.9198494,\n    \"2022-12-06T23:39:00.000Z\": 14.884749,\n    \"2022-12-06T23:44:00.000Z\": 14.8404904,\n    \"2022-12-06T23:49:00.000Z\": 14.5523102,\n    \"2022-12-06T23:54:00.000Z\": 14.7117106,\n    \"2022-12-06T23:59:00.000Z\": 14.7783574,\n    \"2022-12-07T00:04:00.000Z\": 14.384726\n}\n```",
