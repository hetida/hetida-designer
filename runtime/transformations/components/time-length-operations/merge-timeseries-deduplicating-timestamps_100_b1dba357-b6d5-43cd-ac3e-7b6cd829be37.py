"""Merge timeseries deduplicating timestamps

# Merge timeseries deduplicating timestamps

This components merges all timeseries in a multiple timeseries dataframe
of the form provided by the Timeseries Dataframe component. Thereby it avoids
duplicates by moving duplicate timestamps into the future, distributing them
evenly with respect to the next differing timestamp, bounded by a maximum timedelta
providable as paramter.

This component may be useful if
* a signal is measured by multiple sensors
* which may lead to duplicate timestamps (but possibly different values)
* you want to keep all values (e.g. to detect outliers) and methods like
  mean / median aggregation are not suitable
* moving duplicate timestamps into the future does not affect your analysis
  too much.
