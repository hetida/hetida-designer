"""Basic Python Object serialization / model repository

This is a very basic / demo implementation of a model repository and allows
to persist Python objects from a component and load them in another one -
possibly during execution of another workflow. A typical use case is training a
model in a training workflow and persisting it, then load it for predicting in
a prediction workflow.

WARNING: This is currently a proof of concept / work in progress.
For example object names and tags should be validated before actually trying
to write to the file system. It may be replaced by a proper model/object repo
framework in the future. In production deployments models should be stored and
loaded through appropriate adapters (see hetida designer adapter system)
and not via components.
