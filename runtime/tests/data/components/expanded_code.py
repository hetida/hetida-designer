"""Documentation for Alerts from Score

# Alerts from Score

## Description

This component generates a Series indicating starts and ends of anomalous situations.

## Inputs
- **scores** (Pandas Series): Should have a datetime index and float values.
- **threshold** (Float): The value above which a score value is considered anomal.

## Outputs
- **alerts** (Pandas Series): The resulting series of alert indications:
    - 1 indicates a start of an anormal situation
      (first anormal data point after a normal datapoints),
    - -1 indicates an end of an anormal situation
      (first normal data point after an anormal data points),
    - 0 indicates no change of state.

## Details
Takes the given score values and compares them to the given threshold.
Values greater than the threshold are considered anormal.
This is used to return a series of values of -1, 0, or 1 indicating alert stops (-1) and starts (1),
respectively (see output description above for details).

For example if you send in a Series of values
```
[0.2, 0.3, 1.2, 1.7, 1.9, 1.8, 1.1, 0.9, 0.5]
```
and a threshold of 1.0 you get back a Series of values
```
[0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, -1, 0]
```
which can be interpreted as an alert starting at the third and ending at the seventh entry.

## Examples
The json input of a typical call of this component is
```
{
    "threshold": 42,
    "scores": {
        "2020-01-01T01:15:27.000Z": 42.2,
        "2020-01-03T08:20:03.000Z": 18.7,
        "2020-01-03T08:20:04.000Z": 25.9
    }
}
```
