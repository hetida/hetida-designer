# Hetida Designer Python Demo Adapter

The hetida designer Python demo adapter is an example for a generic REST adpater that provides and receives data to/from workflows during execution.

While it maintains its own dependencies and config files here in its subdirectory, development is basically analogous to runtime/backend development.

We therefore refer to the [runtime/backend Readme](../runtime/README.md).
